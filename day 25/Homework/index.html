    <p style="background-color: green;">A zoo (short for zoological garden; also called an animal park or menagerie) is a facility in which animals are kept within enclosures for public exhibition and often bred for conservation purposes.[1]

        The term zoological garden refers to zoology, the study of animals. The term is derived from the Greek<br> ζώον, zoon, 'animal', and the suffix -λογία, -logia, 'study of'. The abbreviation zoo was first used of the<br> London Zoological Gardens, which was opened for scientific study in 1828, and to the public in 1847.[2] The first modern zoo was the Tierpark Hagenbeck by Carl Hagenbeck in Germany. In the United States<br>alone, zoos are visited by over 181 million people annually.</p><br>
