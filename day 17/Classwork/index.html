        <h2>About Pandas</h2>
        <p style="color: darkviolet;">Pandas are large, bear-like mammals that are native to the mountain forests of southwest China. They are easily recognized by their distinct black-and-white coloring and are loved worldwide. Pandas mainly eat bamboo and spend most of their time foraging and eating. Despite being classified as carnivores, their diet is over 99% bamboo.</p>
        <p>Pandas are solitary animals and are known for their playful behavior. They are a symbol of wildlife conservation and are classified as vulnerable due to habitat loss and low birth rates in the wild.</p>
