        <h2>About Red Pandas</h2>
        <p>Red pandas are small, arboreal mammals native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. They have reddish-brown fur, a long, bushy tail, and a waddling gait due to their shorter front legs. Red pandas are herbivores, primarily eating bamboo, but they also consume fruits, acorns, roots, and eggs.</p>
        <p>Red pandas are solitary creatures, mostly active from dusk to dawn. They are excellent climbers and spend most of their time in trees. Although classified as endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation, red pandas are also beloved as the "firefox" of the animal kingdom.</p>
